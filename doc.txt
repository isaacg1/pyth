Pyth documentation 4.1

Each character is a separate token, except for numbers, 
strings, and python literals. Written in Polish notation,
with fixed arities for each operator. Statements are special, 
allow multiple lines.

num = int, float
seq = str, list, tuple
col = str, list, tuple, set

Lines with implicit lambdas indicate the when that function is nested inside another identical function,
the variable which will be used in the lambda expression will advance by one, wrapping around. If
used consecutively, the first variable in sequence will be used each time.

Char, arity, begins line, mnemonic, details. When in doubt, similar to python.

0                        A leading 0 is a separate token, the number 0.
