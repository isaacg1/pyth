Pyth reference and documentation

This file is intended to be read with line wrapping.
Tokens are given in the order: 1 character tokens, by code point, . tokens, by code point.

Types:
num = int, float
cmp = complex
seq = str, list, tuple
lst = list, tuple
idx = str, list, dict
col = str, list, set, dict
any = any expression (a for short)
blk = a code block (any series of statements)
... = any number of arguments of any type.
n:_ = n _ arguments.
var = variable. Not evaluated.
func = function. Not evaluated.
func n = function with arity n.
pfn = Preceding function of arity n. *F, for instance.
l:_ = Lambda with lambda variable(s) _
pos = positive int.
nneg = nonnegative int.
neg = negative int.
none = missing argument.
c/n or col/num = col or num, where num is cast to list using U.
s/n or seq/num = seq or num, where num is cast to list using U.
<type1(type2)> = Type1 whose elements are of the for Type2.

Shorthands:
In the text, A refers to the first argument, B to the second, etc.
If two type definitions overlap, more specific takes precedence.
No operations modify the input unless specifically specified.
x -> y -> z -> ... means on future / nested uses, the successive character is used. If there is an extra -> at the end, it is cyclic.

Format:
Char, Input types         | Effect
